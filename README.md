# jsonator

Takes raw text file from @openfootball/deutschland, computes current matchday, creates json as in @openfootball/football.json as well as javascript data files, plus sqlite database and excel file.

A completely dynamic variation of my fbjsonrobot, with optimized code. No more inpus needed! Works only with complete matchdays, though. For interaction with my blproject.
